Xinyu Tian and Tianyu Wu served as commissioners for the NFT labs. This workshop aims to present the current research achievements and progress of the NFT lab and discuss cooperation opportunities for further research in the NFT field. As the youngest lab in SciEcon, the NFT lab looks forward to sharing our current research with you. Since September 2021, our lab has snowballed, and we currently have nine members with four articles published on SciEcon Research and two articles in progress. We will present our project deliverables at this symposium. We also invited earlier contributors who are pioneers on NFT related topics as distinguished panelists. We expect engaging panel discussions for further collaborations. NFT Background After many years of rapid growth in the blockchain industry, NFTs rose rapidly at the beginning of this year. The whole NFT market achieved more than $2 billion in transactions in the first quarter of 2021\u2014which is 2000 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 [1]. Facing the rapid development of NFT and the Metaverse, we hope to share relevant knowledge in this symposium. Lab Project Overview The research scope of our laboratory includes NFT Marketplace, Metaverse, GameFi, NFT Legal perspective, and NFT Investment. We have carried out exploratory research and published medium articles on SciEcon-Research . For the next milestone, our lab plans to move forward for more original research and innovation. Symposium Sketch The symposium comprises online presentations for five articles, ranging from the NFT marketplace to GameFi, the legal perspective in the NFT world, and the Metaverse. Each presentation lasts 6 minutes, followed by a 30 minutes session of panel discussions. Watch SciEcon NFT Symposium on SciEcon YouTube channel . Symposium Agenda 12/3/2021 China Standard Time (GMT+8) Co-Hosts: Zichao Chen, Yufan Zhang, Prof. Luyao Zhang NFT marketplace: Introduction to NFT and NFT marketplace\u2019s mechanism Author : Zichao Chen (presenter) and Yufan Zhang Medium Article Publication : NFT Marketplace: Introduction to NFT and NFT marketplace\u2019s mechanism Abstract : Our project topic is the NFT marketplace. We have included two articles in this series that introduce the NFT market from shallow to deep. The first article is devoted to introducing and analyzing NFT and the mechanism of the NFT market. We introduced the key idea about NFT and analyzed why NFT can have such high prices. Then we also discussed NFT\u2019s technical standards and its trading marketplace. Finally, we argued the advantages of each auction mechanism. In general, this article will give you a preliminary introduction to the NFT Marketplace. NFT Marketplace: How to Choose the Right NFT Marketplace for Artists and Collectors Author : Yufan Zhang (presenter) and Zichao Chen Medium Article Publication : NFT Marketplace: How to Choose the Right NFT Marketplace for Artists and Collectors Abstract : The article is written to give the guideline to choose the best NFT marketplace for artists and collectors. Many of the current marketplaces are built for certain targeted users with specific purposes such as buying NFT collectives of highlight reels, while some serve a larger group of NFT creators and collectors. Therefore, this article helps people to choose the best NFT marketplace that suits their needs, depending on what the one\u2019s position is in this boom of NFT. A Glance into the Metaverse: the importance of decentralization Author : Xinyu Tian and Zesen Zhuang Medium Article Publication : A Glance into the Metaverse: the importance of decentralization Abstract : The concept of Metaverse has absorbed people\u2019s attention for a long time. The current picture of the Metaverse was mostly created by the leading centralized enterprises, like Facebook, Microsoft, and Google, with high-tech products in game design, wearable devices, and social media platforms. However, considering the public trust issues and potential collapse in centralized institutions, we argue that only with decentralization can the Metaverse be brought to reality. In this article, we firstly analyze the current architecture of Metaverse in the centralized world and then discuss the importance of decentralization, with the problems we find in reality. We use a case study at the end of this article to demonstrate how its functionality fits the idea of Metaverse and how it can be improved with decentralized systems. Explore the sea of NFT - A US-Legal Perspective Author : Tianyu Wu and Jerry Zhang Medium Article Publication : Explore the sea of NFT - A US-Legal Perspective Abstract : The article is written to offer a landscape of what legal problems the Non-fungible Token (NFT) market now encountered under the US Law. With specific examples, we clarify the differences between ownership and other underlying intellectual property rights in NFT. Based on the clarification of these legal terms, we cover the potential copyfraud and infringement problem in the NFT market, and talk about the legitimacy of NFT assets transfer. To connect the NFT market with other traditional legitimate intellectual properties, we discuss the applicability of including the royalties and use qualitative methods to identify whether it would further incentivize artists\u2019 creation and increase the liquidity of the whole NFT market. Last but not least, we design a case study to discuss how value or the function would differ when we have different types of products in the NFT market, in terms of privacy, copyright, and ownership? Will the NFT surge maintain its popularity in the long run? Author : Derrick Adam (presenter) and Lorne Zhang Abstract : The applications and use cases of blockchain technology continue to spread into the different areas of our lives. A blockchain is a distributed public ledger that records transactions. From currency to exchanges, a majority of blockchain technology has focused solely on financial use cases. With NFTs, the use cases for blockchain are set to expand beyond that. With the advent of ERC-721, the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Standard, that describes how to build unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, wide-ranging fields, such as art, music royalties, and collectables, can be introduced to the NFT ecosystem. In this article we introduce some current use cases for NFTs, such as art, collectibles, luxury goods, gaming, and gambling. Financial service and investment in the NFT marketplace Author : Rixin Wang Abstract : As a developing marketplace and a vital part of decentralized finance. What kinds of financial service is offered in the NFT marketplace? And how can investors possibly earn profit through investing in the NFT marketplace? In the article, I focus on three essential and popular aspects of NFT finance: NFT collateralized loans (NFTfi), NFT collective investment schemes and NFT insurance. In addition to data and introduction, there is a considerable amount of first hand experience provided, and I write more as an investor than a researcher. After reading this article, you will be able to form a basic idea of how NFT finance functions and get to know the basic characteristics of it.
