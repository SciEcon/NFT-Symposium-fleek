## About SciEcon NFT Symposium

This seminar is hosted by SciEcon NFT research lab, supervised by professor Luyao Zhang and proposed by the lab leader Zichao Chen and co-leader Yufan Zhang. Xinyu Tian and Tianyu Wu served as commissioners for the NFT labs. This workshop aims to present the current research achievements and progress of the NFT lab and discuss cooperation opportunities for further research in the NFT field.

As the youngest lab in SciEcon, the NFT lab looks forward to sharing our current research with you. Since September 2021, our lab has snowballed, and we currently have nine members with four articles published on SciEcon Research and two articles in progress. We will present our project deliverables at this symposium. We also invited earlier contributors who are pioneers on NFT related topics as distinguished panelists. We expect engaging panel discussions for further collaborations.
